## Installation
If you want to self host this project, the first step is to clone this repo.
```
git clone https://github.com/allaboutishaan/planets-facts-site.git
```
After cloning, run an
```
npm install
```
to snag all of the dependencies. Of course, you need [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. I also strongly recommend [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) as it makes testing *much* easier.<br><br>
Once all the dependencies are installed, run
```
npm start
```
That's it! Once you start the project, it should open up in your browser.
